# Contributing to instascrape
We love developers and want to hear your input! Contributing to this project should be as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer
- etc. 

## We develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. Changes that have been accepted to `master` will also be uploaded to the instascrape PyPI package.

## We use the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), so all code changes happen through pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/chris-greening/instascrape/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/chris-greening/instascrape/issues/new/choose).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. 
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

<!-- ## Use a consistent coding style
This project uses [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) coding style to maintain consistency and readability. Please install [pre-commit first](https://pre-commit.com/#quick-start) to first as discussed below.
## Install pre-commit
`pre-commit` is now used to check the codebase has been formatted across the entire project.
But before installing pre-commit, you need to first have [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort), [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) & [flake8](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8) installed into your local machine. This is so when you commit any changes pre-commit automatically runs first then, warns you of unformatted code or errors.
You can just run these commands separately against your code (e.g. with black the command would look like `black path/to/your/python/code.py` ) before committing changes.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
